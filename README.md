#Dependencies

Requires:
 * AngularJS 1.4.x or higher
 * MomentJS 2.1.x or higher

#Testing
We use karma and linting tools to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use grunt:

```
npm install
npm test
```

The karma task will try to open Chrome as a browser in which to run the tests. Make sure this is available or change the configuration in test\test.config.js

#Usage

## Bower

This project does not directly support bower. If you are using wiredep, you can dd the following to your 
bower.json file to allow wiredep to use this directive.

```json
  "overrides": {
    "angular-date-time-input": {
      "main": [
        "src/dateTimeInput.js",
      ],
      "dependencies": {
        "angular": "^1.x",
        "moment": "^2.x"
      }
    }
  }
```

## NPM
We use npm for dependency management. Add the following to your package

```shell
npm install angular-date-time-input --save
```
This will copy the angular-date-time-input files into your node_modules folder, along with its dependencies.

Load the script files in your application:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/moment/moment.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/angular-date-time-input/src/dateTimeInput.js"></script>
```

Add this module as a dependency to your application module:

```html
var myAppModule = angular.module('MyApp', ['ui.dateTimeInput'])
```

Apply the directive to your form elements:

```html
<input data-date-time-input="YYYY-MMM-DD" />
```

## Options

The value of the date-time-input attribute is the format the date values will be displayed.

Nota bene: The value saved in the model is, by default, a JavaScript ```Date``` object, not a string.
This can result in differences between what is seen in the model and what is displayed.

### date-time-input

This option controls the way the date is displayed in the view, not the model.

```html
<input data-date-time-input="YYYY-MMM-DD" />
```
See MomentJS documentation for valid formats.

### date-formats

This option defines additional input formats that will be accepted. 

```html
<input ... data-date-formats="['YYYY-MMM-DD']" />
```

Nota bene: Parsing multiple formats is considerably slower than parsing a single format. 
If you can avoid it, it is much faster to parse a single format.

See [MomentJS documentation] (http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-formats) for more information.

### date-parse-strict

This option enables/disables strict parsing of the input formats. 

```html
<input ... data-date-parse-strict="false" />
```

### model-type

```html
<input ... data-model-type="Date | moment | milliseconds | [custom format]" />
```

Default: ```'Date'```

Specifies the data type to use when storing the selected date in the model. 

Accepts any string value, but the following values have special meaning (these values are case sensitive) :
 * ```'Date'``` stores a Date instance in the model. Will accept Date, moment, milliseconds, and ISO 8601 strings as initial input from the model 
 * ```'moment'``` stores a moment instance in the model. Accepts the same initial values as ```Date```
 * ```'milliseconds'``` store the epoch milliseconds (since 1-1-1970) in the model. Accepts the same initial values as ```Date```

Any other value is considered a custom format string.
